This is my first Django project. I had three goals with this project: I wanted to use forms, a database, and localStorage. I created three functionalities and worked on all of them to create a functional app.

# Web Pages

Home: A simple home page with three buttons directing the user to the three different buttons. 

Doctors Note: A fake doctor's note generator. A user can fill out a form and the program prints out a convincing doctor's note. 

Broken Cars: A page containing a database of flat tires. The user can query cars based off of their color. 

Excuses: A list of used excuses and ideas for future excuses. These are stored in localStorage for future reference.


# Development Environment

I used VSCode as an IDE.

- Django
- Firebase
